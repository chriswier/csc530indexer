Visit:  http://localhost:3000/

# To build production build: (based from steps 1-3 from https://skryvets.com/blog/2018/09/20/an-elegant-solution-of-deploying-react-app-into-a-subdirectory/)

1. $ cd frontend
2. $ Edit package.json - add the "homepage" variable with the subdirectory it will be in (ex:  "homepage": "/csc530/" )
